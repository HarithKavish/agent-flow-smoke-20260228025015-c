                        <h3>Definition</h3>
                        <p>Marine bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by living organisms through a chemical reaction. This phenomenon occurs primarily in marine environments, where it serves various ecological functions, from communication to predation and defense.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Discovery</h3>
                        <p>The first recorded observation of bioluminescence in marine life dates back to ancient Greece, where Aristotle described glowing fish. However, modern scientific study began in the 19th century, with significant breakthroughs in understanding the chemical and biological processes behind the glow.</p>

                <div class="mechanism-content">
                    <div class="mechanism-step">
                        <h3>Chemical Reaction</h3>
                        <p>The core of bioluminescence lies in a chemical reaction involving two molecules: <strong>luciferin</strong> and <strong>luciferase</strong>. When oxygen reacts with luciferin in the presence of luciferase, energy is released in the form of light. The wavelength of this light varies among species, producing a spectrum from blue to green.</p>

                    <div class="mechanism-step">
                        <h3>Bioluminescent Organs</h3>
                        <p>Organisms produce bioluminescence in specialized cells called <strong>photophores</strong>. These cells are often located in specific regions of the body, such as the underside of fish or the tips of certain jellyfish. The arrangement and structure of photophores determine the type and pattern of light emitted.</p>

                        <h3>Firefly Squid (<em>Watasenia scintillans)</em></h3>
                        <p>Native to the Pacific Ocean, the firefly squid is renowned for its vibrant blue-green light. These squids use bioluminescence to communicate, attract mates, and even to confuse predators.</p>

                    <div class="species-card">
                        <h3>Deep-Sea Anglerfish (<em>Melanocetus johnsonii)</em></h3>
                        <p>One of the most iconic bioluminescent creatures, the anglerfish uses a bioluminescent lure to attract prey in the dark depths of the ocean. The lure emits a soft glow, making it nearly invisible to potential victims.</p>

                    <div class="species-card">
                        <h3>Glass Worms (<em>Pteropods)</em></h3>
                        <p>Glass worms, or pteropods, are small mollusks that produce light to deter predators. Their bioluminescence is triggered by physical stress, allowing them to startle attackers and escape.</p>

                        <h3>Communication</h3>
                        <p>Many species use bioluminescence for communication, such as mating displays or territorial marking. For example, certain fish species emit light patterns to attract mates or signal dominance.</p>

                    <div class="ecology-item">
                        <h3>Predation and Defense</h3>
                        <p>Bioluminescence aids in predation by luring prey into ambush or confusing predators. Conversely, it serves as a defense mechanism, startling attackers or creating counter-illumination to blend into the dark ocean floor.</p>

                    <div class="ecology-item">
                        <h3>Camouflage</h3>
                        <p>Counter-illumination is a technique where organisms emit light to match the light from above, making them invisible to predators from below. This adaptation is particularly common in deep-sea creatures.</p>
